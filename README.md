# Marriott_project
If you are currently engaged in hotel management, I would like to inform you that I have uploaded my 5th-semester project, which was successfully submitted as a 45-day project during my graduation. This project focuses on Marriott Hotel and aims to achieve an aesthetically pleasing frontend design, coupled with effective utilization of CRUD methods in the backend. It utilizes PHP for backend development and database connectivity, while XAMPP Apache serves as the local hosting solution. Additionally, the project leverages HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap for frontend implementation.
